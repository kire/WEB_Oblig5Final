				Yes! I don't read anything after it's come out, because I will not waste my
precious time on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand, according to
you, that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassins. Well, I
think it was Nails that said I was really, really flattered, 'cause he got
it right. And I'm not ... Debate me on AA right now. I have a disease?
Bullshit. I cured it with my brain; with my mind. Check it, Alex, I
embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace
that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I checked, Chaim, I've
spent close to the last decade, I don't know, effortless and magically
converting your tin cans into pure gold.

And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has
paid me in frickin' almost a decade.   They will lose the rest of their
lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So
... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me
a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!
Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight on
with that one and just dispelled that one.
<p>
But I dare anyone to debate me on things.  Yeah, but I can't use the word
'sober' because that's a term from 'those people', and I have cleansed
myself. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This
bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' -
now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math!  And
I was getting a tattoo during the death from above. And it's the banner
from the death card that Kilgore is throwing on his victims. So if you
think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an
excuse.
</p>
<p>
THE BIBLE GRIPPERS! How complicated can it be? What they're not ready for,
is guys like you and I, Nails, and all the other gnarly gnarlingtons in my
life ... that we are high priests ... Vatican assassin warlocks. Boom.
Print that, people. See where that goes. He's as radical as you'd think
he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ... you know ... petting up
the river to kill another part of me, which is 'courage'. But I dare anyone
to debate me on things.  And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't
be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one
of you! ... There it is. And one of those stupid mottoes, Alex, is 'Don't
be special. Be one of us.' News flash! I am special, and I'll never be one
of you! ... There it is. I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it, as I say. I
ain't hidin'.
</p>
<p>
And people say, 'Oh, you know... you have to work through your
resentments.' Yeah. No. I'm gonna hold on to them and they're gonna fuel my
attack. And you know, I'm tired ... I'm so tired of pretending like my life
isn't perfect and bitchin' and just winning every second .... And I'm not
perfect and bitchin', and just delivering the goods at every frickin' turn.
 Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world
by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. Because
I'm just ... um .... I don't know. Why give an interview when you can leave
a warning, you know?  And you know, to sully and to contaminate or
radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll
leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. And Alex, try to get your
mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire
manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of
complete and total surrender.
